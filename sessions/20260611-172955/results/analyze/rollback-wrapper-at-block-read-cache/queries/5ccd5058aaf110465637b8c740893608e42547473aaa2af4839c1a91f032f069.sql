-- analyzer params: run_id=8, limit=50
-- Top contract-call functions by total wall time in one run.
--
-- Purpose
--   Surfaces which Clarity contract functions dominate execution time, so the
--   triage agent can decide whether the run's hot Clarity-VM spans
--   (lookup_variable, lookup_function, etc.) are concentrated in a small set
--   of contracts (worth a per-contract optimization) or spread broadly (worth
--   a generic VM-path optimization).
--
-- Parameters
--   :run_id  benchmark_run.id
--   :limit   max rows
--
-- Invocation
--   sqlite3 -header -csv "$DB" \
--     ".parameter set :run_id 1" \
--     ".parameter set :limit 20" \
--     ".read queries/top_contract_calls.sql"
