-- analyzer params: run_id=11, limit=50
-- Top Clarity-budget consumers per (issuer, contract, function) in one run.
--
-- Purpose
--   The throughput-lens entry point for triage. Surfaces which contract
--   functions burn the most deterministic Clarity budget across the run, on
--   each of the five axes that gate per-tenure tx capacity. Distinct from
--   `top_contract_calls.sql` (which ranks by wall time) — a contract that
--   runs cheaply per call but consumes a large share of the runtime/read/
--   write budget is exactly the kind of family the throughput lens needs to
--   surface, and the wall-time ranking will miss.
--
--   See `README.md` ("Clarity cost columns") for the EXACT semantics of
--   `clarity_runtime`, `clarity_read_count`, `clarity_read_length`,
--   `clarity_write_count`, `clarity_write_length`. They are deterministic
--   Clarity budget units, NOT timings, NOT bytes-on-disk, NOT raw MARF/
--   SQLite operation counts. A tenure ends when the first of these five
--   budgets hits its block cap, so the *binding* axis (the one closest to
--   its cap) is what actually limits throughput.
--
--   `max_block_*` columns are the worst-block aggregate consumption per
--   axis — i.e. for the block where this contract.function consumed the
--   most of that axis, what was the SUM across all calls in that block.
--   Critical: this is computed from per-block sums, NOT per-tx maxima.
--   A contract called 10 times in one block (each costing 100 runtime
--   units) contributes 1000 to that block's runtime aggregate, not 100.
--   Compare against `stacks_block_stats` aggregates to identify which axis
--   is binding for the worst blocks; the analyzer will validate this in
--   code.
--
--   `max_axis_share_pct` is the maximum of the five `pct_run_*` columns —
--   i.e. the most-consumed axis as a share of run total. Rows are ordered
--   by this descending so write-heavy contracts (high pct_run_write_length
--   but low pct_run_runtime) surface alongside runtime-heavy ones rather
--   than being hidden by `LIMIT`. Tiebreak on sum_runtime for stability.
--
--   Cross-epoch caveat: aggregates over Clarity cost columns may span
--   Stacks epoch boundaries with different cost weights — see README.md.
